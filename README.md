To construct TypeCite, we assembled a team of specialists from academia, publishing, and education, all of whom felt that citation generators should be redesigned from the ground up. Rather than relying on standard algorithms, we built TypeCite to respond to the nuances of academic style. TypeCite does not simply scan databases to see what citations it can find; it analyzes those citations to make sure that they are accurate and complete. This takes the strain out of citing, allowing students to focus on the difficult tasks of writing and researching.
